    ================================================ YOUR CODE HERE ====================================================
    Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using your learned logistic regression
                  parameters (one-vs-all). You should set p to a vector of predictions, p[i] in range(1, num_labels).

    Hint: you can use `np.argmax` to get the index of a given element in an array.
          Example usage when dealing with a vector
          ```
          p = np.argmax(output)  #  returns the index of the output vector's maximum element
          ```
